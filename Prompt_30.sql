 Hello. Recently I lost my precious baby! I'm contacting all local shelters regarding my love, Juno! 
 He's a Beagle-Hound Mix and white as a sheet! He's getting old but he really is quite spry,
 he loves socializing and he got lost not too long ago. Please tell me if you have a dog like that!
 I miss my baby â˜¹
